# Twitter Visualisation

We visualise Twitter data of people in each item showing how they reacted to a topic on "homosexuality". We have tracked their tweets for a particular period of time. The project visualises both inter and intra network connections.

Work to be done: Add Set visualisations to undestand groups, inclusion and exclusion.
